# java-xss
A XSS framework in Java, JavaScript, PHP and HTML.
The idea is to put the event.js script into HTML source code,
and use the xss.java to execute JavaScript on the remote browser.
Currently i'm working on the event.js to be able to read out variables, so the event.js file could contain errors. If you need to be sure it works, use event_working.js instead.

// better description to come soon
