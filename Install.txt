Put event.js and event.txt into your web server,
compile the xss.java (on most systems: javac xss.java)
(modify the file path (default: /var/www/html/event.txt) in xss.java before compiling.)
NOTE: event.js is under development, use event_working.js if event.js doesn't work.
i'll throw it in a commit message if it's broken.

Oh by the way, the default file paths are for debian linux. I've made a separate branch for Mac OS X (using XAMPP)
see the install.txt there for more details.

One good day I'll make a install script.
