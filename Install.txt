Put event.js and event.txt into your web server,
compile the xss.java (on most systems: javac xss.java)
(modify the file path (default: /var/www/html/event.txt) in xss.java before compiling.)
NOTE: event.js is under development, use event_working.js if event.js doesn't work.
i'll throw it in a commit message if it's broken.

Oh by the way, the default file paths are for debian linux. tough this can run on any OS, just moduify the file paths.

One good day I'll make a install script.
